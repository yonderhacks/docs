Contributor's Guide
===================

When contributing to any of our programmes, please first discuss the change you wish to make via our official communication channel, or any other method approved by the Developer/Maintainer of the said hack before making the change. 

Please note we have a *Code Of Conduct* and *Safeguarding Policy*, so do ensure that you follow them in all your interactions within this platform.

Pull Request Process For Hosted Projects
----------------------------------------

In the event that you are contributing to this codebase, please insure that you:

1. remove 'install' or 'build' dependencies before the end of the layer when doing a 
   build.
2. update the *README.md* of said hack with details of changes to the interface, this includes new environment variables, exposed ports, useful file locations and container parameters.
3. increase the version numbers in any examples files and related documents to the new version that your *Pull Request* would represent. The versioning scheme we use is `Git <http://git-scm.com/>`__.
4. merge the *Pull Request* in once you have the sign-off of two other developers, preferably a maintainer, or if you do not have permission to do that, you may request a second reviewer to merge it for you.
